# DynamicPDFServlet

This is the example code that goes with my blog post 

http://paulshipley.id.au/papers/coding/dynamic-pdf-servlet

This is a technique for dynamically creating and serving PDF documents.

The client requirement was to take an input value, query a database, then use the values returned to display a PDF and the name of the PDF file had to be based on the input value.

While I could find many examples for doing this, they all seemed to be confusing, incomplete or both. As we were already using iText to work with PDF files, this seemed like an obvious tool to use as part of the solution.

This example uses Servlets and iText to display the PDF and their usage is described. The full source code is available (below). The example also uses JSP, Struts 2 and CSS; I am not discussing these in detail here â€“ the reader is welcome to investigate the source code themselves.
